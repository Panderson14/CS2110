# CS2110

In CS 2110, we continued to program in Java. This time, there was more of an emphasis on group work, which is evident in the four person project called “TicTacNine”. Our group programmed a Tic-Tac-Toe game that involved winning several games of Tic-Tac-Toe, such that each win was marked by an “X” or an “O” on the bigger board. Whoever got a Tic-Tac-Toe on the bigger board won the game.

I personally took on more of a managerial role in the project, making sure that we were all working on tasks, ensuring that our code was up-to-date, and that everyone was agreeing on the direction the project was heading. I also coded much of the base framework.

The other folder called “Code” is the collection of homework assignments that I programmed by myself in Java. These were very simple, bite-sized chunks of code to get us used to object-oriented programming.
